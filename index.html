<p>If your dream garden is a welcoming place buzzing with life, activity, bees hovering over flowers and butterflies 
    finding a safe place to feed and rest, you are not alone.
     Creating a pollinator garden is actually easy: 
     you can start small and add more helpful plants and other pollinator-friendly features gradually,
      as your time and resources allow. Inviting pollinators to your garden helps you grow your own veggies and fruits, while 
    also providing living space to other creatures who are crucial to life on our planet.</p>
    <p>Your pollinator garden does not even have to be somewhere in a separate corner of your property.
         Adding beneficial plants here and there, on the edges of your vegetable beds or along the walking path
          does not take much space but could really make a difference for pollinators visiting your garden. 
          While some plants, like milkweed, can be toxic  and are better kept farther away from edible gardens, lots of pollinator-friendly 
        plants are harmless, and some of them can be great food for people, too!   </p>
<a id="how to start"><h2>How to start a pollinator garden</h2></a>
<p>The easiest way to start a pollinator garden is to check what's already growing on your property 
    and allow it to grow and spread a little more. For example, if you mow around a small patch of white clover, chances are
you will eventually have more than one patch, and pollinating insects love clover! 
Of, if you are noticing small purple blossoms around you garden in early spring,
 it could be  henbit deadnettle
attracting first bees and butterflies with its sweet nectar.  </p>
<p>Some herbs commonly grown by people for their own consumption can be also delicious food for pollinators
     and their caterpillars. Dill tastes great in lots of dishes,
      but its leaves are also loved by swallowtail caterpillars. Mint and lemon balm make aromatic tea,
       while attracting pollinators to their flowers. Growing plants that people and pollinators can share
    is another simple way of welcoming beneficial insects to your garden.  </p>
<a id="plants"><h2>Plants to choose</h2></a>
<p>If you would like to grow plants which specifically benefit pollinators in your garden,
    you could start with a few common ones that will not need much care and 
are tolerant to different weather and soil conditions.    </p>
<div class="plant-gallery">
    <img class="gallery" src="https://github.com/elenademi/pollinators/blob/main/wild%20bergamot.png" alt="wild bergamot flowers">
    <p>Wild bergamot (Monarda fistulosa), which may be commonly known as bee balm, is a 
        beautiful decorative perennial plant. It preferrs sunny spots and tolerates 
        various types of soil. It attracts different kids of bees, as well as predatory wasps.
        You can purchase a live plant or grow wild bergamot from seeds, which can be 
        planted directly into the soil in spring. 

    </p>
    <img class="gallery" src="" alt="salvia flowers blooming">
    <p>Salvia, with its colorful bright blue blossoms,  is constantly surrounded by buzzing bees and 
        other pollinators. This hardy plant survives both blistering hot and soggy wet days. It keeps 
        growing more flowers for months. There are different varieties of salvias, and most of them
        can be grown as perennials. 
    </p>
    <img class="gallery" src="" alt="monarch butterfly on a milkweed plant">
    <p>Milkweed (Asclepias spp.) is well-known as the only food source for monarch caterpillars, which require
        its leaves to survive. In addition, monarch butterflies, as well as many other types
    of pollinators, enjoy the nectar from its flowers. There are various species of milkweed, and it's best to 
    plant the ones that are native to your area. Milkweed is toxic to people and pets, and can also become
    invasive, so it is best to plant it in its own designated space.</p>

<a id="resources"><h2>Resources</h2></a>
<div class="resources">
        <p><a href="https://xerces.org/" class="resources">The Xerces Society for Invertebrate Conservation</a>, in their own words,
         "is an international nonprofit organization that protects the natural world through the conservation of invertebrates
          and their habitats." Pollinator conservation is one of their main areas of work.
        They have programs in different parts of the world, and you can find lots of useful information about
    pollinators and preserving their habitats on the website.</p>
    
    <p><a href="https://nababutterfly.com/" class="resources"> North American Butterfly Association</a> helps find all the information you need to create
         a butterfly habitat in your garden. You can find a list of plants local to your 
        area, which provide not only food for adult butterflies but also for their growing caterpillars.
        The best part is, you can join NABA's certification program and get your garden 
        certified as a butterfly habitat! You can display a beautiful sign in your garden 
        and help educate others about the value of attracting pollinators to your area.
